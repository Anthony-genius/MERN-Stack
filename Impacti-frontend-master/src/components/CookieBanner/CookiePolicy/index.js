      <p>We use two main types of cookies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Session Cookies</strong>: A session cookie is stored for only
          as long as you stay on our website or Services and is removed once you
          close your browser. We use session cookies to uniquely identify you as
          you navigate so that we can ensure any choices you make are correctly
          applied to you.
        </li>
        <li>

          text file stored on your hard drive for a limited period of time. We
          use persistent cookies to remember your login ID if you click

      <h3>Third-party websites</h3>
      <p>
        We also use third-party cookies to help with performance. Third-party
        cookies are those placed by other websites or organizations when you

        who provide services for website A and its users may place a cookie on
        your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Google Analytics is one of the most widespread and trusted
        analytics solution on the web for helping us to understand how you use
        the site and ways that we can improve your experience. These cookies may
        track things such as how often you visit, how long you spend on the site
        and the pages that you visit. All information gathered by these
        third-party cookies are aggregated and anonymized, so cannot be traced
        directly back to you.
      </p>
      <p>

        external third-party site. We cannot control their privacy and cookie
        policies of third parties, including, without limitation, those of any
        partner or affiliate. You may wish to consult the policies of these
        third party sites to understand their use of cookies and privacy
        policies.
